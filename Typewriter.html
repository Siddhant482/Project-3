        A typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical deivce with an array of keys that, when pressed, cause an inked ribbon
        to strike the paper, printing a single character at a time to create legible, permanent documents. The main types of typewriters
        are categorized by size and mechanism. They are mostly bought these days by collectors and their price is highly variable, depending 
        on the brand, condition and rarity. Most models sell between $75 - $300 but again, depending on the rarity and age, they can for 
        couple thousand dollars.
