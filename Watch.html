        A watch is a compact timepiece designed to be worn on the wrist. They are primariliy categorized by their movement, which
        dictates how they are powered and keep time: Quartz watches use a battery and a vibrating crystal for high accuracy and affordability; Mechanical watches
        rely on coiled mainspring and intricate gears, favored for their craftmanship and heritage. The cost of watches spans a vast range,
        starting from under $100 all the ways up to tens of thousands of dollars.
